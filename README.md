# Safari-Opener

Ever since OS X 10.10, I've switched from Chrome as my main web browser to Safari, for a lot of reasons. One huge piece of functionality I missed, however, was being able to open a set of tabs at open. 
When this app is opened, it opens safari with a given set of tabs rather than the default options Safari gives you.


# How to use: 

Clone the repo and open up the file scrip in Applescript Text Editor. Where you see the Strings of website URL's, replace with whatever websites you want. 

Then, export the script as an application by: File -> Export. From there, select the type as an Application and make sure the "Stay open" box in not checked. This way the "app" will close after Safari starts.

You can add it to the Dock and change the Dock icon using this guide: http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Mac-OS-X-Icons. 

Enjoy this super simple functionality boost.

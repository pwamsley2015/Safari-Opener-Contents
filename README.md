# Safari-Opener

Ever since OS X 10.10, I've switched from Chrome as my main web browser to Safari, for a lot of reasons. One huge piece of functionality I missed, however, was being able to open a set of tabs at open. 
When this app is opened, it opens safari with a given set of tabs rather than the default options Safari gives you.
